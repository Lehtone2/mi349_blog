                <p>I wake up and then check my phone and make sure I didn't miss anything important. I check my classes on D2L and make sure I have nothing that I have to do immediately, in this order:</p>

                <h2>Evenings:</h2>
                <p>My evenings are usually about winding down. After dinner, I'll check once more if anything new popped up for class or work. Then, I might watch a show or hang out with friends online. I always try to leave at least thirty minutes before bed for relaxing away from screens. It helps me get a better night's sleep and reset for the next day. Even though I don't sleep very well.</p>

            <p>
                Walks are one of the simplest yet most effective ways to improve overall heatlh. Fresh air and light exercise help wake the body, especailly in the morining, thus energizing the mind, and preparing your for the day. Unlike high-intensity workouts, walking is accessible to almost everyone, requiring no equiptment or special training.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond physical health, morning walks promote mental well being. Walking in nature reduce stress, improves mood, and enhances focus. Studies suggest that even 20 minutes of walking daily can lead to significant long term benefits. Personally, I've a decent amount of improvement in my productivity whenever I stick to this habit.
